                each respects
                the worth and dignity of the other and accepts a mutual responsibility for creating an ethos where
                teaching and learning
                can flourish and where each one can fully develop his or her potential.

                Together, we will strive to build a school where young minds, spirits and bodies, rooted in sound moral
                values and an
                acceptance of our common humanity under God, can be nurtured and encouraged to reach new frontiers.

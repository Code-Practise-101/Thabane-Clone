<h2>What to expect</h2>
<p>
    We care for our learners and instil in them a sense of respect for each other and every other person. 
    Our target is a 100% pass in matric and every grade, every term of every year. 
    Our first matric group obtained 90% pass rate in November 2007.
     We are hoping to provide opportunities for our learners beyond the class, 
     like Gadaffi Nkosi and Claudia Masemola who received scholarships to study in America. We strive to produce world class graduates.

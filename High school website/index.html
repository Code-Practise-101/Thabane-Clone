                            This school was established to enable all young people who enrol here to build together
                         a future where each respects the worth and dignity of the other and accepts a
                          mutual responsibility for creating an ethos where teaching and learning can 
                          flourish and where each one can fully develop his or her potential.
                        </p>

Together, we will strive to build a school where young minds, spirits and bodies, rooted in sound moral values and an acceptance of our common humanity under God, can be nurtured and encouraged to reach new frontiers
